## Running the Pygame Traffic Test

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed:

   You can check if you have Python 3 installed by:
   ```sh
   python3 --version
   ```
   
2. Install dependencies:

   Recommended (cross-platform &mdash; pip):
   ```sh
   pip install pygame matplotlib
   ```
   This installs both Pygame and Matplotlib using pip.

   Linux (Debian/Ubuntu) alternative if the pip method doesn't work:
   ```sh
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install python3-pygame python3-matplotlib
   ```

3. Clone the repository or download the source code:

   ```sh
   git clone git@github.com:IChaudhry892/csce-4430-project.git
   ```

4. Navigate to the `pygame-traffic-test` directory:

   ```sh
   cd pygame-traffic-test
   ```

5. Run the test:

   ```sh
   python3 main.py
