## Running the Pygame Traffic Test

1. Make sure you have Python 3 and `pygame` installed:

   You can check if you have Python3 installed by:
   ```sh
   python3 --version
   ```

   Install Pygame by:
   
   ```sh
   pip install pygame
   ````
   
   If the previous command didn't work, you could also try:
   
   ```sh
   sudo apt install python3-pygame
   ```
   
3. Navigate to the `pygame-traffic-test` directory:
   ```sh
   cd pygame-traffic-test
4. Run the test:
   ```sh
   python3 main.py
